## Overview

I rebuilt this sign-up form using **HTML** and **CSS**, leveraging modern layout techniques like **Flexbox** to create a responsive and clean design. The form includes fields for name, email, phone, password, and confirmation password.

## Features

- **Responsive layout:** The form adapts nicely to different screen sizes using Flexbox.
- **Custom font and styling:** Used Google Fonts and a custom font for a unique look.
- **JavaScript-powered password validation:**
  - Real-time password strength meter.
  - Minimum length validation (at least 8 characters).
  - Visual feedback to users on how secure their password is.
- **Confirm password matching check:** Warns users if passwords donâ€™t match.

## How It Works

- The form structure is built with semantic HTML, including `<form>`, `<fieldset>`, and `<label>` tags.
- CSS Flexbox is used extensively to layout fields side-by-side and stack them vertically as needed.
- JavaScript listens to user input on the password field:
  - It updates a colored strength meter bar.
  - It shows a text message indicating the password length and whether it meets the minimum length.
  - It checks if the confirmation password matches, showing an error message if not.
